# VeganRecipiesV1
I made a small python webscraping script for a particular website. If u run the code, you get a csv file with all the recipes + link to the recipe + ingredients.
Its my first time doing something THIS fancy so any comments/ideas are welcomed ^.^ 


This is the website that i used: https://www.pickuplimes.com and i highly reccomend the recipes ü•∫‚ù§
